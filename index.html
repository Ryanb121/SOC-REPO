            "After studying the natural sciences at the University of Cambridge,
            broadcaster David Attenborough began his career as a producer at the
            BBC, where he launched the successful Zoo Quest series. Attenborough
            was made controller of BBC Two in 1965 and later was named its
            director of programming. During his tenure, the station crossed over
            to color television, and Attenborough was instrumental in expanding
            its natural history content. Attenborough left the BBC to begin
            writing and producing various series, including the smash hit Life
            on Earth, which set the standards for the modern nature documentary.
            Since then Attenborough has written, produced, hosted and narrated
            countless award-winning, nature-focused programs and has devoted his
            life to celebrating and preserving wildlife."
